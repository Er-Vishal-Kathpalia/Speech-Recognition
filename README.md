## Speech-Recognition

***This is the Speech Recognition software that i made while using PyQt5***

Speech recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers. It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition or speech to text (STT). It incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science, linguistics and computer engineering fields.

[Pyqt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)

## PyQt5
Qt is set of cross-platform C++ libraries that implement high-level APIs for accessing many aspects of modern desktop and mobile systems. These include location and positioning services, multimedia, NFC and Bluetooth connectivity, a Chromium based web browser, as well as traditional UI development.

PyQt5 is a comprehensive set of Python bindings for Qt v5. It is implemented as more than 35 extension modules and enables Python to be used as an alternative application development language to C++ on all supported platforms including iOS and Android.

PyQt5 may also be embedded in C++ based applications to allow users of those applications to configure or enhance the functionality of those applications.

## Project Discription

It is the GUI based project that i made with using pyqt5 Qtdesigner and then provide the backend code to it.

There are different section in my software

* Search anything on Google- You can search anything on google Just say "open Github on google". It will directly open github page on your default browser search in google.
* Search anything on Youtube- You can search anything on Youtube Just say "open Arijit Singh Songs". It will directly open youtube page on your default browser search in Youtube.
* Search any URL- You can search any URL while giving input in speech.
* Open any application/Software in your computer/laptop- You can say "Open Word", "Open Calculator", "Open Powerpoint/Excel", "Open Settings", "Open Command Prompt".Anything you can open on your laptop if it is available in your system.
* Read News- You can also give this software the command "Open news section" and the news will appear on the screen while using this software.
* Read and Listen Novel- As i am fond of novels. So you can open any novel from your pc in the form of .pdf or .docx and can listen and read it through this software.

## Build With

## Prerequisites
1. You need to have Python installed on your device.
2. You need to install SpeechRecognition, pyaudio and PyQt5 library on python while going to command prompt and type-
```
pip install SpeechRecognition
```
```
pip install pyaudio
```
```
pip install PyQt5
```
## Usage of Speech Recognition Software
To Run it You need to put this software in one folder as it has many dependent codes of differnet section connected with each other. So place it in one folder.
Open controller.py and run it on your idle or using command
```
python controller.py
```
The GUI based interface will appear on the screen and you can give it any command.
